Earlier definitions of Chondrostei are now known to be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor. There were 52 species divided among two orders, the [[Acipenseriformes|Acipenseriformes]] ([[Sturgeon|sturgeons]] and [[Paddlefish|paddlefishes]]) and the [[Polypteriformes|Polypteriformes]] ([[Reedfish|reedfishes]] and [[Bichir|bichirs]]). Reedfish and birchirs are now separated from the Chondrostei into their own sister lineage, the [[Cladistia|Cladistia]]. It is thought that the chondrosteans evolved from bony fish but lost the bony hardening of their cartilaginous skeletons, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton, suggesting that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish. This group had once been classified with the [[Shark|sharks]]: the similarities are obvious, as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish, and both lack [[Scale_(zoology)|scales]] (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include [[Spiracle_(vertebrates)|spiracles]] and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] extend into the larger lobe of the [[Caudal_fin|caudal fin]]).

Measure 22 used a straight horizontal boundary between the two colors rather than following the [[Sheer_(ship)|sheer]] of the main deck, making a characteristic gray \"wedge\" at the bow.

Moderately high visibility to aerial observation at close ranges.\" This measure was used in the Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II, and was often referred to as \"Atlantic two-tone.\" It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the [[Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea|Battle of the Philippine Sea]].\nDue to the desire for a darker version for greater utility against air attack after the appearance of the [[Kamikaze|kamikaze]], Measure 12 was revived in 1945, but amended so as to be identical to Measure 22 save for the use of Ocean Gray rather than Haze Gray._cell_7_3_1", "predicted_label": 0}

As Shizuka goes in for her first audition at Prussia Studio, she becomes nervous about going up against popular voice actress Rina So\u0304ma. When she is the next one to audition, her nervousness gets the better of her, although the director is impressed. Meanwhile, Aoi receives a call from her mother, who congratulates her on her work on Exodus! despite her confusion about the story, and informs her that her father was also impressed. The scene then flashes back to the time Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori presented their club's anime back in high school; although the students were unimpressed by it, the five of them still found pride in their work. The next day, Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka meet up with Misa, now a 3D computer graphics operator, and Midori, a college student who is aspiring to be a scriptwriter. Together, they watch a movie, visit the park, go shopping, and get some drinks. While at Shizuka's workplace, Aoi, Ema, and Misa tell each other about the hardships they are experiencing at work, while Shizuka laments that she has not done anything significant in her work and that she did not do too well on her audition. Later on, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who asks for her help, but when he goes off-topic, she hangs up on him. When the get-together ends and Aoi and Ema ride the train home, the former remarks that she does not have a concrete anime-related goal in mind. While walking home, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who again tries asking for help, but she hangs up on him. The next day, things become hectic at the office with Seiichi being behind on storyboards and Ryo\u0304suke deciding to drop out of directing the eighth episode following an argument with Taro\u0304._cell_0_8_0 [SEP] With three weeks left until the delivery of the final episode, the entire Musashino staff reinforces their efforts to get the episode done with the time they have left. The work is particularly focused on the scene featuring Shizuka's character, which is assigned to Ema at her own request after she was touched by Shizuka's performance. Meanwhile, Shizuka finds enjoyment in being able to land minor voicing roles, while Misa stays up the entire night at her workplace creating a CG model for a fighter jet. On the day of the delivery, after the episode is finally completed, the production staff is tasked with delivering the final tapes to the various TV stations across the country in time for the airing by any means necessary. As the others reach their assigned destinations in time, Aoi is held up by several transport delays and is forced to complete the remainder of her trip by running to her destination on foot. While reaching the TV station, she reflects on everything she learned from her friends in the past few years, which strengthens her resolve to keep making anime. At the celebratory party for the final episode's airing, Aoi is praised for the support she provided to the rest of the Musashino staff and is brought onstage to give a toast to everyone involved in the anime's production. She delivers a speech praising everyone's pooled efforts for making The Third Aerial Girls Squad and reminding them to continue this teamwork and bring further inspiration to anime viewers worldwide. Afterwards, Watanabe and Katsuragi decide to have Musashino Animation work on two anime simultaneously as their next projects. Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori meet up at a balcony and reaffirm their resolve to one day remake the anime they made back in high school, also promising each other to continue making great anime along the way._cell_0_48_0 [SEP] Taro\u0304 tries to reason with Ryo\u0304suke and his decision, but he refuses to listen. Taro\u0304 then vents his anger to Aoi and blames her for the situation, explaining that the argument was the reason behind the phone calls. With the storyboards for the final episode way behind schedule, being a month late, chief production assistant Yutaka Honda, desperate for progress, goes to extreme lengths and locks Seiichi inside a cage in the storage room in order to get him to finish them, despite his protests. Taro\u0304 explains to Aoi that he got caught up as the middle man between Ryo\u0304suke, who wanted to do the key frames for an explosion scene, and the 3D director Yu\u0304ichiro\u0304 Shimoyanagi, who had already prepared a CGI explosion, the result of which led Ryo\u0304suke to believe people were favoring 3D over 2D and drop out of directing the eighth episode. An unsatisfied Aoi accuses Taro\u0304 of not handling the situation better and tries to tell Honda about it, but he talks her out of it. Caving under the pressure of his new work environment, Seiichi recounts how his once successful career as an anime director took a downfall after the release of Jiggly Jiggly Heaven, and it is revealed Exodus! is his first official anime in six years. Whilst having a drink with his coworker Hotta Hikari, Ryo\u0304suke learns from animator Saburou Kitano about how he is teaching 3D animators himself, stating that it is not about whether 3D is better or not, but rather how it can be used to improve the quality of anime. Aoi and Ema meet up and eat at the latter's house, where they talk about how 3D is continuing to influence the production of anime, which is what led Misa to choosing her career path. The next day, while showing Ryo\u0304suke the 3D-rendered scene of the explosion, Aoi learns that the beginning of episode nine, which follows on from the explosion in the eighth episode, had been finished using key animation._cell_0_10_0", "predicted_label": 1}

After Suleiman crossed the river [[Drava|Drava]] at [[Osijek|Osijek]], instead of taking the usual route for Vienna, he turned westwards into Ferdinand's held Hungarian territory. After taking a few minor places, he laid siege to a border town called [[Ko\u030bszeg|Gu\u0308ns]] (Ko\u030bszeg).

In both versions, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains.\nAlthough he was stopped at Ko\u030bszeg and failed to conquer Vienna, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle, Suleiman additionally secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts. Immediately after the Ottoman withdraw, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary.

After a painful afternoon of missions, the other penguins agree to take Private to see Lunacorns on Ice to cheer him up. Skipper also agrees to let Private bring his fellow Lunacorn fans along, agreeing before learning that the fellow fans are Roy and Bing. With the difficulty of getting the large mammals to the show, Kowalski recommends scrubbing the mission, but Skipper is determined to keep his promise for fear that disappointing Private would lead him to evolve into a hipster. After the six manage to get to the arena, Roy and Bing are seen outside by a stagehand who believes they are part of the show and pushes them inside before the penguins enter themselves. On ice, Roy and Bing unintentionally get in the way of the Lunacorn actors while interacting with their heroes, which entertains the audience but irritates the director until Skipper and Rico are able to contain the chaos. Roy and Bing are later added to The Lunacorns TV show, which disappoints Private because a penguin character was not added._cell_1_23_0 [SEP] The animals get zoo visitors to feed them popcorn until Alice catches a boy giving some to Marlene. Alice yells at the boy and slaps \"Do not feed the animals\" signs around the zoo. The animals assemble to determine how to get popcorn on their own, but the penguins and lemurs do not want to work together. The penguins and lemurs each get their own bag of popcorn from zoo storage. When they get back to the zoovenir shop, they find kernels instead. Julien believes they are \"popcorn eggs\" that need to be hatched. The penguins try interrogating a kernel, but Alice finds a trail of them leading to their habitat. Private and Skipper hide the bag in the incinerator, causing a popcorn explosion. They land in Marlene's habitat and she congratulates them on their job well done. Meanwhile Julien thinks he has been rewarded by the salty snack gods.\nNote: This episode was originally released direct-to-DVD on February 6, 2009 as part of the Double DVD Pack of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. It was aired in other countries before being aired in the U.S. on May 9, 2009._cell_1_32_0 [SEP] After being annoyed by the lemurs, the penguins decide to take a vacation to the moon to get away from them. They launch a rocket to reach their desired destination but, unbeknownst to them, wind up on a rooftop across from the zoo instead of on the lunar surface. There, they meet a stray cat who they believe to be a \"moon cat\" who takes kindly to the foursome with an ulterior motive to eat them, though he later befriends them for real when given a gift of canned fish. After leaving the \"moon\", however, the penguins realize they had never left Earth. During the time the penguins are on their mission, Julien and the other lemurs deal with booby traps in the penguins' habitat while trying to \"borrow\" their TV.

No. 8 signals give warning of a gale or storm from one of the four quadrants. A gale ranges from 63 to 87 kilometres per hour and storm from 88 to 117 kilometres per hour. Gusts may exceed 180 kilometres per hour.\n(gale: up to 54 miles per hour;\nstorm: up to 72 miles per hour &\ngust up to 111 miles per hour)\nThe timing of the issuance of the first of these signals is aimed to give about 12 hours warning of gales generally over Hong Kong near sea level, but the warning may be shorter for exposed areas and on high ground. Unexpected intensification of the tropical cyclone on accelerated movement closer to Hong Kong may reduce the warning period. When these signals are interchanged indicating an anticipated change in the direction of the gale or storm, the wind shift may be expected within a few hours.\nWhen one of these signals is issued, ferries generally stop running and all schools and law courts are closed. People away from home should either return immediately or find a safe place and remain there until the danger has passed. Windows and doors should be bolted and shuttered and cars parked in sheltered areas. Full typhoon precautions should be completed as soon as possible as it is extremely dangerous to delay these until No. 9 or No. 10 signal is issued._cell_4_3_3 [SEP] No. 1 signal is an advisory signal. It calls attention to the fact that there is a tropical cyclone centred within about 800 kilometres of Hong Kong that might later affect Hong Kong. If strong winds are not expected within 24 hours, the issuance of the signal may be delayed until the circulation moves closer or intensifies, but it should not be assumed that there will be a 24-hour interval between the issuance of No. 1 signal and the onset of strong winds.\nWhen No. 1 signal is issued, staff required to take precautions during tropical cyclones should report to their offices and remain on call. Small crafts should remain within reach of shelter. Attention should be paid to weather bulletins as records show there are three chances in four that No. 1 signal will be followed by strong wind or gale warnings.\nSome tropical cyclones that only lead to a No. 1 signal may still have an impact on Hong Kong, by bringing rainy weather, swells over the sea and stronger winds of up to 40 km/h. It is possible for winds over offshore waters to reach gale force occasionally.\nThe No. 1 signal may also be issued when a tropical cyclone is departing Hong Kong but strong winds are still affecting offshore waters._cell_4_1_3 [SEP] No. 9 signal indicates that the gale or storm is expected to increase significantly in strength.\nThis signal indicates that the centre of a typhoon will soon pass close to Hong Kong, with the consequent shifting of wind direction. Alternatively, the No. 9 signal generally implies that the wind speed has already reached storm force (88 to 117 kilometres per hour) and has a chance of increasing to hurricane force in a short period of time. Hence, the signal is not issued for severe tropical storms, but may be maintained after a typhoon weakens into a severe tropical storm.\nAll precautions should have been completed prior to the issuance of No. 9 signal._cell_4_7_3", "predicted_label": 1}

She added that \"Kosovo is an independent state and its territory is inviolable. [All states should] move beyond the issue of Kosovo's status and engage constructively in support of peace and stability in the Balkans.\" She called on those states that have not yet recognised Kosovo to do so, while concluding: \"Serbia and Kosovo are both friends and partners of the United States. Now is the time for them to put aside their differences and move forward, working together constructively to resolve practical issues and improve the lives of the people of Kosovo, Serbia, and the region. This is the path toward their future, as part of a Europe, whole, free, and at peace, and we welcome the European Union's efforts to assist both countries in realizing their European aspirations.\" In a Foreign Press Center briefing, US legal adviser Harold Koh emphasized that \"the court made clear that issues about secession were beyond the scope of its decision, and so they didn't pass on those questions.\" Assistant Secretary at the State Department, Philip H. Gordon, said, \"I would also underscore that the court's opinion was closely tailored to the unique circumstances of Kosovo. This was about Kosovo. It was not about other regions or states. It doesn't set any precedent for other regions or states. Kosovo's independence is a fact...That needs to be the starting point for any discussion...This shouldn't be seen as a win or a loss for anyone. It's an opportunity for everybody to win, and it's not anti-Serbia, it is as I say, an opportunity to get on with what will be in the interest of both countries.\" A spokesman for the [[U.S._State_Department|U.S. State Department]] has said \"The ICJ ruling strongly asserts that Kosovo's declaration of independence is legal, a judgement we support\" and called on Europe to unite behind a common future. He also said the court ruling \"decisively agreed with the longstanding view of the United States that Kosovo's declaration of independence is in accordance with international law ... and its territory is inviolable. We call on those states, who have not yet done so, to recognize Kosovo. Now is the time for them \u2013 for Kosovo and Serbia to put aside their differences and move forward, working together constructively to resolve practical issues to the betterment of the lives of the people of Kosovo, Serbia, and the region. This is the path forward \u2013 this is the path toward their future, as part of a Europe, whole, free, and at peace.\" When asked by a reporter about concerns in Spain and the precedence for the [[Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)|Basque country]] and Catalonia he said \"But this was a very \u2013 a set of facts unique to Kosovo. The court was applying these facts. We don't think it's applicable to any other situation.\" American diplomats said the right time to move forward and reach an agreement, however they added the caveat \"that shall not be possible as long as the story over Kosovo is being led by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic. The USA and the EU are now requesting from Serbia not to insist on the resolution at the UN or at least not on the wording requesting negotiations over the status. Should Serbia however decide to submit its resolution, the USA or Albania would file a resolution.\" The ambassador of the United States in Pris\u030ctina denied saying Thaci was \"prepared to offer to the north of Kosovo a kind of autonomy\" modeled after autonomies implemented in the regions of Belgium, Austria and other Western European countries. Instead is said the U.S. government strongly supports Kosovo's status \"as an independent state,\" and its \"territorial integrity.\"_cell_3_14_1 [SEP] The Foreign Ministry said \"the resolutions of the UN International Court are recommendations and have no binding force. Second, the UN International Court has not yet responded about the legitimacy of the creation of Kosovo as a state. We can also stress the fair arguments, voiced by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which said in its statement yesterday that the UN International Court did not consider the legitimacy of the unilateral proclamation of independence by Kosovo, did not refer to possible implications of such a proclamation and did not say whether Kosovo was a state or not.\" It also noted that unlike the Kosovo issue, which was being dealt with by the UN, the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh was being resolved through the mediation of the [[Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]. It insisted that the ICJ ruling applies only to Kosovo and Serbia and cannot have any ramifications for the Karabakh conflict. Spokesman Elkhan Polukhov was quoted as saying that Azerbaijan would continue to regard Kosovo as a part of Serbia. Azeri leaders have also repeatedly stated that Karabakh's predominantly Armenian population should only be able to determine the extent of the territory's autonomy within Azerbaijan, arguing that among other things, there already exists an independent Armenian state._cell_4_2_1", "predicted_label": 0}

The California Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") retains information about the purchaser and seller of all in-state firearm sales and transfers, and requires that any firearms imported into the state be reported to the DOJ. Furthermore, the Attorney General is required by law to maintain a registry containing the fingerprints and identifying information of the transferee, and the unique identifying information of every firearm transferred in the state, pursuant to \u00a711106. All handgun serial numbers and sales are recorded by the state in the Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System, along with those of many long guns. While there is no requirement for California residents to register handguns owned prior to 1991 with law enforcement, \u00a712025 and \u00a712031 enhance several misdemeanor offenses to felonies if the handgun is not on file in the Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System. New residents must register handguns (purchased outside of California) with DOJ within 60 days. As of January 1, 2014, long gun serial numbers are also recorded, whereas previously only the sale was recorded. However, it is not required that owners of long guns purchased prior to 2014 register their firearms and it is not a crime to be in possession of an unregistered firearm._cell_4_2_4 [SEP] 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.4 forbids the government from creating a firearm registry.

{"input": "Haruka Chisuga, 28, is an actress and singer who started her career on the 2014 anime television series Shirobako. As Shizuka goes in for her first audition at Prussia Studio, she becomes nervous about going up against popular voice actress Rina So\u0304ma. When she is the next one to audition, her nervousness gets the better of her, although the director is impressed. Meanwhile, Aoi receives a call from her mother, who congratulates her on her work on Exodus! despite her confusion about the story, and informs her that her father was also impressed. The scene then flashes back to the time Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori presented their club's anime back in high school; although the students were unimpressed by it, the five of them still found pride in their work. The next day, Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka meet up with Misa, now a 3D computer graphics operator, and Midori, a college student who is aspiring to be a scriptwriter. Together, they watch a movie, visit the park, go shopping, and get some drinks. While at Shizuka's workplace, Aoi, Ema, and Misa tell each other about the hardships they are experiencing at work, while Shizuka laments that she has not done anything significant in her work and that she did not do too well on her audition. Later on, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who asks for her help, but when he goes off-topic, she hangs up on him. When the get-together ends and Aoi and Ema ride the train home, the former remarks that she does not have a concrete anime-related goal in mind. While walking home, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who again tries asking for help, but she hangs up on him. The next day, things become hectic at the office with Seiichi being behind on storyboards and Ryo\u0304suke deciding to drop out of directing the eighth episode following an argument with Taro\u0304._cell_0_8_0 [SEP] With three weeks left until the delivery of the final episode, the entire Musashino staff reinforces their efforts to get the episode done with the time they have left. The work is particularly focused on the scene featuring Shizuka's character, which is assigned to Ema at her own request after she was touched by Shizuka's performance. Meanwhile, Shizuka finds enjoyment in being able to land minor voicing roles, while Misa stays up the entire night at her workplace creating a CG model for a fighter jet. On the day of the delivery, after the episode is finally completed, the production staff is tasked with delivering the final tapes to the various TV stations across the country in time for the airing by any means necessary. As the others reach their assigned destinations in time, Aoi is held up by several transport delays and is forced to complete the remainder of her trip by running to her destination on foot. While reaching the TV station, she reflects on everything she learned from her friends in the past few years, which strengthens her resolve to keep making anime. At the celebratory party for the final episode's airing, Aoi is praised for the support she provided to the rest of the Musashino staff and is brought onstage to give a toast to everyone involved in the anime's production. She delivers a speech praising everyone's pooled efforts for making The Third Aerial Girls Squad and reminding them to continue this teamwork and bring further inspiration to anime viewers worldwide. Afterwards, Watanabe and Katsuragi decide to have Musashino Animation work on two anime simultaneously as their next projects. Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori meet up at a balcony and reaffirm their resolve to one day remake the anime they made back in high school, also promising each other to continue making great anime along the way._cell_0_48_0 [SEP] Taro\u0304 tries to reason with Ryo\u0304suke and his decision, but he refuses to listen. Taro\u0304 then vents his anger to Aoi and blames her for the situation, explaining that the argument was the reason behind the phone calls. With the storyboards for the final episode way behind schedule, being a month late, chief production assistant Yutaka Honda, desperate for progress, goes to extreme lengths and locks Seiichi inside a cage in the storage room in order to get him to finish them, despite his protests. Taro\u0304 explains to Aoi that he got caught up as the middle man between Ryo\u0304suke, who wanted to do the key frames for an explosion scene, and the 3D director Yu\u0304ichiro\u0304 Shimoyanagi, who had already prepared a CGI explosion, the result of which led Ryo\u0304suke to believe people were favoring 3D over 2D and drop out of directing the eighth episode. An unsatisfied Aoi accuses Taro\u0304 of not handling the situation better and tries to tell Honda about it, but he talks her out of it. Caving under the pressure of his new work environment, Seiichi recounts how his once successful career as an anime director took a downfall after the release of Jiggly Jiggly Heaven, and it is revealed Exodus! is his first official anime in six years. Whilst having a drink with his coworker Hotta Hikari, Ryo\u0304suke learns from animator Saburou Kitano about how he is teaching 3D animators himself, stating that it is not about whether 3D is better or not, but rather how it can be used to improve the quality of anime. Aoi and Ema meet up and eat at the latter's house, where they talk about how 3D is continuing to influence the production of anime, which is what led Misa to choosing her career path. The next day, while showing Ryo\u0304suke the 3D-rendered scene of the explosion, Aoi learns that the beginning of episode nine, which follows on from the explosion in the eighth episode, had been finished using key animation._cell_0_10_0", "predicted_label": 1}

Furthermore, the Attorney General is required by law to maintain a registry containing the fingerprints and identifying information of the transferee, and the unique identifying information of every firearm transferred in the state, pursuant to \u00a711106. All handgun serial numbers and sales are recorded by the state in the Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System, along with those of many long guns. While there is no requirement for California residents to register handguns owned prior to 1991 with law enforcement, \u00a712025 and \u00a712031 enhance several misdemeanor offenses to felonies if the handgun is not on file in the Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System. New residents must register handguns (purchased outside of California) with DOJ within 60 days. As of January 1, 2014, long gun serial numbers are also recorded, whereas previously only the sale was recorded.

As Shizuka goes in for her first audition at Prussia Studio, she becomes nervous about going up against popular voice actress Rina So\u0304ma. When she is the next one to audition, her nervousness gets the better of her, although the director is impressed. Meanwhile, Aoi receives a call from her mother, who congratulates her on her work on Exodus! despite her confusion about the story, and informs her that her father was also impressed. The scene then flashes back to the time Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori presented their club's anime back in high school; although the students were unimpressed by it, the five of them still found pride in their work. The next day, Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka meet up with Misa, now a 3D computer graphics operator, and Midori, a college student who is aspiring to be a scriptwriter. Together, they watch a movie, visit the park, go shopping, and get some drinks. While at Shizuka's workplace, Aoi, Ema, and Misa tell each other about the hardships they are experiencing at work, while Shizuka laments that she has not done anything significant in her work and that she did not do too well on her audition. Later on, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who asks for her help, but when he goes off-topic, she hangs up on him. When the get-together ends and Aoi and Ema ride the train home, the former remarks that she does not have a concrete anime-related goal in mind. While walking home, Aoi receives a call from Taro\u0304, who again tries asking for help, but she hangs up on him. The next day, things become hectic at the office with Seiichi being behind on storyboards and Ryo\u0304suke deciding to drop out of directing the eighth episode following an argument with Taro\u0304._cell_0_8_0 [SEP] With three weeks left until the delivery of the final episode, the entire Musashino staff reinforces their efforts to get the episode done with the time they have left. The work is particularly focused on the scene featuring Shizuka's character, which is assigned to Ema at her own request after she was touched by Shizuka's performance. Meanwhile, Shizuka finds enjoyment in being able to land minor voicing roles, while Misa stays up the entire night at her workplace creating a CG model for a fighter jet. On the day of the delivery, after the episode is finally completed, the production staff is tasked with delivering the final tapes to the various TV stations across the country in time for the airing by any means necessary. As the others reach their assigned destinations in time, Aoi is held up by several transport delays and is forced to complete the remainder of her trip by running to her destination on foot. While reaching the TV station, she reflects on everything she learned from her friends in the past few years, which strengthens her resolve to keep making anime. At the celebratory party for the final episode's airing, Aoi is praised for the support she provided to the rest of the Musashino staff and is brought onstage to give a toast to everyone involved in the anime's production. She delivers a speech praising everyone's pooled efforts for making The Third Aerial Girls Squad and reminding them to continue this teamwork and bring further inspiration to anime viewers worldwide. Afterwards, Watanabe and Katsuragi decide to have Musashino Animation work on two anime simultaneously as their next projects. Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori meet up at a balcony and reaffirm their resolve to one day remake the anime they made back in high school, also promising each other to continue making great anime along the way._cell_0_48_0 [SEP] Taro\u0304 tries to reason with Ryo\u0304suke and his decision, but he refuses to listen. Taro\u0304 then vents his anger to Aoi and blames her for the situation, explaining that the argument was the reason behind the phone calls. With the storyboards for the final episode way behind schedule, being a month late, chief production assistant Yutaka Honda, desperate for progress, goes to extreme lengths and locks Seiichi inside a cage in the storage room in order to get him to finish them, despite his protests. Taro\u0304 explains to Aoi that he got caught up as the middle man between Ryo\u0304suke, who wanted to do the key frames for an explosion scene, and the 3D director Yu\u0304ichiro\u0304 Shimoyanagi, who had already prepared a CGI explosion, the result of which led Ryo\u0304suke to believe people were favoring 3D over 2D and drop out of directing the eighth episode. An unsatisfied Aoi accuses Taro\u0304 of not handling the situation better and tries to tell Honda about it, but he talks her out of it. Caving under the pressure of his new work environment, Seiichi recounts how his once successful career as an anime director took a downfall after the release of Jiggly Jiggly Heaven, and it is revealed Exodus! is his first official anime in six years. Whilst having a drink with his coworker Hotta Hikari, Ryo\u0304suke learns from animator Saburou Kitano about how he is teaching 3D animators himself, stating that it is not about whether 3D is better or not, but rather how it can be used to improve the quality of anime. Aoi and Ema meet up and eat at the latter's house, where they talk about how 3D is continuing to influence the production of anime, which is what led Misa to choosing her career path. The next day, while showing Ryo\u0304suke the 3D-rendered scene of the explosion, Aoi learns that the beginning of episode nine, which follows on from the explosion in the eighth episode, had been finished using key animation._cell_0_10_0", "predicted_label": 1}

Only five pairs competed in the competition, meaning that two competitors did not compete. The HouseGuests participated in a selection process beginning with Ryan \u2013 as selected by random draw. Natalie and Kato were not selected and were awarded immunity from the first eviction._cell_2_3_0 [SEP] At the nomination ceremony Ricky nominated Dina and Kandi.\nDuring the veto ceremony Lolo chose not to use the Power of Veto keeping nominations the same. Julie then interviewed fake HouseGuest, and main twist of the season, Anthony Scaramucci.\nThe HouseGuests then participated in the first live vote and eviction of the evening by voting to evict who they wished to leave the house. On Day 29, with a tie vote of 1\u20131, Ricky was forced to break the tie; Ricky cast the sole vote to evict Kandi. Kandi was the seventh to be evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house and became the seventh juror.\nWith Dina, Tamar, and Lolo all nominated by default; Ricky participated in the second live vote and eviction of the evening by casting the sole vote to evict two of the three effectively choosing who he wishes to take with him to the final two. Also on Day 29 Ricky chose to evict Dina and Lolo. Dina and Lolo became the eighth and ninth to be evicted as well as the eighth and ninth jurors respectively. The jury then had a chance to ask the final two questions prior to placing their votes. Ricky and Tamar also had the chance to give a final speech in an attempt to persuade the jury to vote for them. The jury then voted on who they think should win the game. For the second time in Big Brother US history and the first time since the [[Big_Brother_10_(American_season)|tenth season]] in 2008 the jury vote was unanimous. Tamar became the second winner of Celebrity Big Brother receiving $250,000 making Ricky the runner-up who received $50,000.
